Technologies: Python, OpenCV, MTCNN, Computer Vision

Developed a real-time face detection and tracking system that identifies 
and tracks human faces in video streams.

Utilized MTCNN for accurate face detection, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces.

Implemented KLT algorithm for real-time tracking, ensuring smooth detection and 
tracking of moving faces.

core features
MTCNN to detect faces in video streams 
bounding boxes around detected faces.

KLT algorithm to track faces across frames.
Ensure smooth tracking even when faces move or rotate.

Enhancements
a face recognition model
database of known faces
display name of the recognized person
option to blur or pixelate detected faces for privacy protection
multi-threading to handle video processing and tracking efficiently
