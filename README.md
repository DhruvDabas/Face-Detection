# Face-Detection

This project implements a real-time face detection system using Python and OpenCV. It uses **MTCNN** for accurate face detection and bounding box drawing.

## Features
- Real-time face detection from webcam.
- Lightweight and easy to use.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- MTCNN
